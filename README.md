# MVAR

This code fits a multivariate autoregressive model to a dataset using a least squares method. It is based on the method used in Khan et al. (2018), Nature Neuroscience, Poort et al. (2022), Neuron, and Chadwick et al. (2022), Neuron. The code has been updated to allow for arbitrary numbers of stimuli and behavioural variables. Matlab and Python versions are available.
